    <h2>Monkee-Boy</h2>

    <p class="intro">We are a boutique web service firm focused on user experience, design, development, inbound marketing, measurement, and maintenance.</p>

    <p>Founded in 1998 by Aaron Bramwell, Monkee-Boy has evolved from a small, two-person web design and development shop to a full-service web, mobile, and marketing team based in one of the greatest cities in the world: Austin, TX. For 16 years we've been helping clients achieve their goals on the web by finding custom solutions that do two things: solve your unique problem and deliver tangible results.

      <h2>The Position</h2>

      <p class="intro">We’re looking for an experienced front end web developer to join the Monkee-Boy team.</p>

      <p>Applicants should be able to independently handle the development of a website from start to finish, be it static templates, WordPress, or an unfamiliar CMS. This position involves working closely with both the design and maintenance teams. Projects range from individually-managed WordPress sites to collaborating with the full development team on larger customized projects. This is a full time position and will be required to work from the Monkee-Boy World Headquarters in beautiful Austin, Texas.</p>

      <p>The candidate will be competitively compensated based on work experience, demonstration of success, and other intangibles they bring to the table. They will be able to participate in all employee incentive programs.</p>

      <h2>The Requirements</h2>

      <p class="intro">We need a developer who has a strong and unnatural love for the Front End.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Complete and up-to-date understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Experience with responsive design.</li>
        <li>Comfortable using version control, we love git.</li>
        <li>A basic understanding of PHP.</li>
        <li>Strong knowledge of cross-browser and cross-device quirks along with knowing how to debug each browser and device.</li>
        <li>Enough experience with WordPress to build a custom theme with advanced functionality from scratch.</li>
        <li>Comfortable working with API's like Google Maps, Twitter, Facebook, etc.</li>
        <li>Basic Photoshop skills for being handed a PSD.</li>
        <li>Great organization skills with the ability to manage and bounce between multiple projects in a day.</li>

      <h2>The Extras</h2>

      <p class="intro">Each of the below will get you a +1 with us.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript unit testing. We are currently exploring Mocha tests as part of our process.</li>
        <li>Know when jQuery is overkill and vanilla JavaScript will do the job with increased performance. Dropping jQuery is on our roadmap.</li>
        <li>An understanding of performance when it comes to your code. An example would be when to use CSS animations vs JavaScript along with best practices. We have an increasingly important goal around speed and performance for our projects.</li>
        <li>Web accessibility, and not just alt tags. ARIA roles, skip links, transcripts, color contrast, etc. We say this is an extra but honestly you need to have a decent understand of accessibility to start with.</li>
        <li>A love for being creative with UI animations, hover effects, and in general trying new user interactions.</li>
        <li>A deep love for open source and contributing as much as you possibly can.</li>
        <li>A strong passion for learning new technologies and collaborating with a team.</li>
        <li>An unnatural love of Torchy’s breakfast tacos.</li>

      <h2>The Dev Team</h2>

      <p class="intro">This application process is not a one way street. It’s important not only for you to be a good fit for us but that we are a good fit for you. We won’t take it personally if you pass on us.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If you’ve browsed <a href="http://www.monkee-boy.com/about/the-troop.php">The Troop</a> page you might already know that the development team consists of two front end developers, one back end developer, and two developers that can’t figure out if they like front end or back end best so they just do both.</li>
        <li>We love git. If you don’t, we feel pretty strongly that you’ll be convinced by your first lunch.</li>
        <li>On the front end side we use sass, gulp, jQuery, WordPress, Bower, Foundation, Susy and Vagrant.</li>
        <li>On the back end our language of choice is PHP. Some of us also have experience with Ruby on Rails and Python. None of us do ASP.</li>
        <li>Since we love git, you can imagine how we feel about GitHub. We actively try to contribute to open source where possible. From open sourcing some of our internal apps to submitting pull requests to projects we use. Our <a href="https://github.com/Monkee-Boy">profile</a> speaks for itself.</li>
        <li>Outside of using WordPress we have some clients on SurrealCMS and are actively developing our own custom content management system (using CakePHP).</li>
        <li>We like to dabble when we can in things like Ember.js, Angular.js, Laravel, Jekyll, and more.</li>
        <li>Although the majority of the team works on Macs, you will be free to use whatever you are comfortable with. *cough*mac*cough*</li>
        <li>We love to collaborate. Whether it’s in the office throwing around new ideas, asking each other for help, or meeting up at a nearby coffee shop for a little change of scenery.</li>
        <li>Finally we are not alone in the jungle. We work intimately with an incredibly talented team.</li>
