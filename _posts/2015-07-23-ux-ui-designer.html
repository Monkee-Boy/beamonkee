      <h2>The Design Team</h2>

      <p class="intro">This application process is not a one way street. It’s important not only for you to be a good fit for us but that we are a good fit for you. We won’t take it personally if you pass on us.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If you’ve browsed <a href="http://www.monkee-boy.com/about/the-troop.php">The Troop</a> page you might have seen that our design team is pretty tight-knit. We have two UX/UI Designers, a Creative Director, and you! UX/UI Designers lead their own projects and will be providing mentorship and training as well as the Creative Director.</li>
        <li>We’re split between Mac and PC: those of us on Macs primarily use Sketch + Photoshop and those of us on PC use Illustrator + Photoshop. You’ll have the freedom to pick whichever setup you prefer.</li>
        <li>We love InVision, and think you will too (if you don’t already!)</li>
        <li>We’re big on sharing ideas and social bookmarking, whether it’s a new button animation we saw or a cool illustration on Dribbble.</li>
        <li>We’re pretty active in the design community, and believe in giving back where we can. We <span class="font-reset">♥</span> hackathons, meetups, and panel discussions outside of work hours.</li>
        <li>We love to collaborate. Whether it’s in the office throwing around new ideas, asking each other for help, or meeting up at a nearby coffee shop for a little change of scenery.</li>
