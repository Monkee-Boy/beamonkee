      <h2>The Dev Team</h2>

      <p class="intro">This application process is not a one way street. It’s important not only for you to be a good fit for us but that we are a good fit for you. We won’t take it personally if you pass on us.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If you’ve browsed <a href="http://www.monkee-boy.com/about/the-troop.php">The Troop</a> page you might already know that the development team consists of two front end developers, one back end developer, and two developers that can’t figure out if they like front end or back end best so they just do both.</li>
        <li>We love git. If you don’t, we feel pretty strongly that you’ll be convinced by your first lunch.</li>
        <li>On the front end side we use SASS, gulp, jQuery, WordPress, Bower, Foundation, Susy and Vagrant.</li>
        <li>On the back end our language of choice is PHP. Some of us also have experience with Ruby on Rails and Python. None of us do ASP.</li>
        <li>Since we love git, you can imagine how we feel about GitHub. We actively try to contribute to open source where possible. From open sourcing some of our internal apps to submitting pull requests to projects we use. Our <a href="https://github.com/Monkee-Boy">profile</a> speaks for itself.</li>
        <li>Outside of using WordPress we have some clients on SurrealCMS and are actively developing our own custom content management system (using CakePHP).</li>
        <li>We like to dabble when we can in things like Ember.js, Angular.js, Laravel, Jekyll, and more.</li>
        <li>Although the majority of the team works on Macs, you will be free to use whatever you are comfortable with.</li>
        <li>We love to collaborate. Whether it’s in the office throwing around new ideas, asking each other for help, or meeting up at a nearby coffee shop for a little change of scenery.</li>
        <li>Finally we are not alone in the jungle. We work intimately with an incredibly talented team.</li>
