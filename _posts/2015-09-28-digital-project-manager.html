      <h2>The Position</h2>

      <p class="intro">Monkee-Boy Web Design, Inc. is looking for a Digital Project Manager who can lead and manage multiple web design and development projects and ensure that overall project goals and objectives are met within project scope and timelines.</p>

      <p>The Digital Project Manager will collaborate and work closely with our project team to refine existing processes as well as adapt and develop new processes as needed.</p>

      <p>Ideal candidates will be college graduates with 4+ years of experience working in a web/creative agency with a range of clients (from small businesses to enterprise level corporations). Candidates should be very comfortable handling conflict resolution (not that it happens that often), being the single point of contact for projects, and running meetings and conference calls with clients.</p>

      <p>Candidates should also have a thorough understanding of web browsers, web design best practices, modern web development capabilities, SEO, and digital marketing. You should not always have to "get back to clients" after checking with other team members.</p>

      <h2>Compensation</h2>

      <p>This position will be a full-time position. The candidate will be competitively compensated based on work experience, demonstration of success, and other intangibles they bring to the table. They will be able to participate in all employee incentive programs.</p>
